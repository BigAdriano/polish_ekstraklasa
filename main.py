#After extracting this string, the program gathers only necessary data: clubs names and all matches results thanks to RegEx.
#When all of them are gathered, final table of Ekstraklasa is being prepered.
#In order to do that, 6 rules from this webpage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%9322_Ekstraklasa) are followed.
#As a final step, two Excel file are created - one with matrix of all match results and another one with final table of Ekstraklasa.
#Also chart with points achieved by given teams is created and shown.
